## Project Rules for TypeScript Development

These project rules are crafted to establish a foundation for building robust, scalable, and maintainable TypeScript projects. They emphasize collaboration, code quality, and efficient development workflows.

### I. Project Setup and Configuration

1.  **TypeScript Configuration:**

    - Use a tsconfig.json file at the root of the project.
    - Extend a shareable configuration (e.g., @tsconfig/recommended) to ensure a solid starting point.
    - { "compilerOptions": { "strict": true, "strictNullChecks": true, "strictFunctionTypes": true, "noImplicitAny": true, "noImplicitThis": true, "moduleResolution": "node", "target": "esnext", "module": "esnext" }}
    - Configure paths for easier module imports and absolute paths.
    - Set a proper outDir to keep compiled files separate from source files.
    - Use isolatedModules to ensure compatibility with various build tools.

2.  **Linting Configuration:**

    - Use ESLint with the @typescript-eslint/recommended and @typescript-eslint/stylistic plugins.
    - Configure ESLint to work with TypeScript's type checker for more accurate linting.
    - Integrate ESLint with your editor and CI/CD pipeline.
    - Use a consistent ESLint configuration across all projects.
    - Use .eslintignore to exclude files/folders from linting.

3.  **Formatting Configuration:**

    - Use a code formatter (e.g., Prettier) to enforce a consistent code style.
    - Configure Prettier to work with TypeScript, JavaScript, and other relevant file types.
    - Integrate Prettier with your editor and CI/CD pipeline.
    - Use .prettierignore to exclude files from formatting.

4.  **Version Control:**

    - Use Git for version control.
    - Use a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow, trunk-based development).
    - Use meaningful commit messages.
    - Use a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control (e.g., node_modules, dist).

5.  **Dependency Management:**

    - Use npm, yarn, or pnpm for managing dependencies.
    - Use exact versioning (--save-exact) for critical dependencies to avoid unexpected breaking changes.
    - Keep dependencies updated regularly.
    - Analyze dependencies for security vulnerabilities and update or replace them as needed.

### II. Code Structure and Organization

1.  **Modular Architecture:**

    - Organize code into modules based on functionality.
    - Use clear naming conventions for files and directories.
    - Favor composition over inheritance where appropriate.

2.  **Component-Based Design:**

    - Break down the UI into small, reusable components.
    - Follow a consistent component structure and naming convention.
    - Define component props and state clearly using types or interfaces.

3.  **State Management:**

    - Choose a state management solution based on the project's complexity (e.g., React Context, Redux, Zustand, Recoil).
    - Follow a consistent pattern for managing state.
    - Keep state as close to the components that use it as possible.

4.  **Error Handling:**

    - Implement robust error handling.
    - Use try-catch blocks for handling exceptions.
    - Use TypeScript's Result type or similar patterns to handle operations that can fail.
    - Display user-friendly error messages.

### III. Development Workflow

1.  **Code Reviews:**

    - Conduct regular code reviews.
    - Provide constructive feedback.
    - Focus on code quality, performance, and maintainability.
    - Ensure that new code adheres to project standards.

2.  **Testing:**

    - Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    - Use a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Cypress, Playwright).
    - Aim for high test coverage.
    - Write tests that are clear, concise, and easy to maintain.
    - Run tests in the CI/CD pipeline.

3.  **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**

    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline.
    - Automate builds, tests, and deployments.
    - Use environment variables for managing configurations across different environments.
    - Ensure that deployments are reproducible and rollback-able.

4.  **Documentation:**

    - Write clear and concise documentation.
    - Document APIs, components, and complex logic.
    - Use JSDoc for documenting code.
    - Keep documentation up-to-date.
